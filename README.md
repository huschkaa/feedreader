## Overview
```
In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.
```
## Install
```
Ensure you have moved to a location in your directory where you want to copy the project via, "cd":

$ Git Clone https://github.com/huschkaa/feedreader.git
```

This was a project for my Udacity Front End Development project. So a big shout out to them for helping in the development of this game. I highly recommend the program and if you are interested for more details, check out [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).
